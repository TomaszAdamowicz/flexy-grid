Flexbox responsive grid

What is flexy?

flexy is a css grid which uses flexbox. It is heavily inspired by skeleton.css responsive .css boilerplate, which I have used in many my projects. Due to arrival of flexbox, grid based on floats, hacks etc. is no longer needed. I've decided to write my own flexbox grid based on experience which I've had with skeleton. I borrowed from skeleton idea of column width based on % and it's behaviour with media queries. It has only one breakpoint for responsive layout (550px).
